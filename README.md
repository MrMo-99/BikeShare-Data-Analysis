## Introduction
 
 Cyclistic is a Bike-Sharing coompany based in Chicago that possess more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to use their bikes for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute for work each day. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The company offers single day passes, full day passes for a price for casual users, and provie an annual subscription fee for its members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe creating a marketing campaign solely focused on casual users would help convert casual users into members. The company has set a clear goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into members. In order to do so they need to better understand the difference between how casual users differ from subscribed members and interest in analyzing the historical bike data trip to help identify trends.
