## Introduction
 
 Cyclistic is a Bike-Sharing coompany based in Chicago that possess more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic users are more likely to use their bikes for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute for work each day. Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. The company offers single day passes, full day passes for a price for casual users, and provie an annual subscription fee for its members. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. 


Cyclistic has concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Therefore, maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe creating a marketing campaign solely focused on casual users would help convert casual users into members. The company has set a clear goal of designing marketing strategies aimed at converting casual users into members. In order to do so they need to better understand the difference between how casual users differ from subscribed members and interest in analyzing the historical bike data trip to help identify trends.

## Problem Statements

The Company's analysts have inferred that annual members are much more profitable for the company than casual users, so they believe that the key of the company's future is depended upon maximizing the number of annual memberships. 

The business-related problem statements that could be asked to improve the company's growth rate and success is shared below:
 1. How do casual users and annual subcribed members use Cyclistic Bikes differently?
 2. How can we design new marketing strategies to help convert casual members into annual members?

## Preparing Data for Analysis

For this project, I've used the 13 trip-data datasets dated from April 2020 to April 2021. Click on this [link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) to access the website and download the datasets provided as .zip files. The data provided in this website is made available to access to the public.

Or you could access and download the data from this repository named as "Raw Data".

I am using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio in this part of the project to help process and analyze the datasets.

First make sure to import all of the dataset as a .csv file to the database server.
Check and verify if the data types of each of the columns in each dataset is same to merge them all together.

**Note: The start_station_id column of dataset from Dec 2020 to April 2020 contains string values**

```TSQL

## Processing of Data

Here, I will be transforming and organizing data by adding new columns, extracting information and removing bad data and duplicates.

```TSQL
 -- Adding a new column to calculate the ride length from datetime2

ALTER TABLE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]
ADD ride_length int

UPDATE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]
SET ride_length = DATEDIFF(MINUTE, started_at, ended_at)


-- Extracting month and year from datetime2 format and adding them as new columns


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]
ADD day_of_week nvarchar(50),
month_m nvarchar(50),
year_y nvarchar(50)

UPDATE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]
SET day_of_week = DATENAME(WEEKDAY, started_at),
month_m = DATENAME(MONTH, started_at),
year_y = year(started_at)


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]       
ADD month_int int

UPDATE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]             -- Extracting month num from datetime2 format
SET month_int = DATEPART(MONTH, started_at)


ALTER TABLE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]       
ADD date_yyyy_mm_dd date

UPDATE [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]             -- Casting datetime2 format to date
SET date_yyyy_mm_dd = CAST(started_at AS date)
```



**In order to get accurate analysis, validate and make sure the dataset does not include any bias, incorrect data, and duplicates.**



```TSQL

/* Deleted rows where (NULL values), (ride length = 0), (ride length < 0), (ride_length > 1440 mins)
   for accurate analysis */


DELETE FROM [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]
Where ride_id IS NULL OR
start_station_name IS NULL OR
ride_length IS NULL OR
ride_length = 0 OR
ride_length < 0 OR
ride_length > 1440


-- Checking for any duplicates by checking count

Select Count(DISTINCT(ride_id)) AS uniq,
Count(ride_id) AS total
From [dbo].[all_data_202004_202104]

## Visualizing Data

In this phase, we will be visualizing the data analyzed and tables created using Tableau Public.

For the interactive version, [Click here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohammed.amja5151/viz/BikeShareAnalysisVisualized/BikeShareAnalysisVisualized)

**Average Ride Duration:**


From inferring to the figure shown below. We can conclude that casual members on average tend to ride bikes for a longer duration of time than annual members.

**Users Per Day Of the Week:**

The data suggests that casual users are more inclined to use the bikes on a weekend, while members tend to use them more on weekdays.

**Hourly Traffic Analysis of Users**

Although both groups seem to prefer evening rides, from **3:00PM - 7:00PM**, annual members also seem to have higher usage in the morning from **6:00AM - 9:00AM**.

**Monthly User Traffic**

The graph depicts that irrespective of the user type, the usage of their bikes are highest in the months **June - October**. While lowest traffic occurs from **November - March**.

## Conclusion

After performing the collection, transformation, cleaning, organisation and analysis of the given 13 datasets, we have enough factual evidence to suggest answers to the business-related questions that were asked.

We can infer that casual users are more likely to use their bikes for a longer duration of time. Casual users are also more inclined to ride during evening hours of **3:00PM - 7PM** and weekends is when most of the casual users prefer to ride. While user traffic for both groups are highest during the months of summer, the months of winter is when user traffic significantly drops for both user types.

In order to design new marketing strategies to better focus on and suit the casual users to help convert them into buying annual memberships, we have to refer to the analysis provided above and keep those facts in mind. The recommendations I would provide to help solve this business-related scenario is shown below.

#### Top Recommendations to Marketing Strategists:

* Implement advertising annual memberships prices more using billboards/posters near the top 20 most popular stations for casual users.
* Provide a limited discount on annual memberships purchased during the months of lowest traffic to increase rider usage in these months.
* Have frequent advertisements on social media and television during peak hours and peak months, since that is when most people have a thought about riding bikes.
* Start provide free ride minutes for every minute passed after 30 minutes of usage, where the free minutes can **ONLY** be redeemed on weekdays to help promote rider usage during weekdays.
